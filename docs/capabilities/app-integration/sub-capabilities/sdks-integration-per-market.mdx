# SDKs integration per market

## Overview
The SDKs integration per market functionality manages the integration of third-party Software Development Kits (SDKs) with appropriate market-specific configurations. This ensures that integrations comply with local regulations, performance standards, and business requirements.

## Current State
Provides a framework for managing SDK integrations across markets, with the ability to enable, disable, or configure SDKs differently in each market. Includes versioning, initialization control, and performance monitoring for all integrated SDKs.

## Technical Details
- Market-specific SDK configuration
- Conditional SDK initialization
- SDK version management
- Privacy compliance controls by market
- Performance impact monitoring
- SDK dependency management
- Fallback mechanisms for SDK failures

## Overview
The Feature Integration functionality provides capabilities for integrating features into the application in a consistent and maintainable way. This includes defining entry points to journeys, configuring features by market, and managing language and copy for features.

## Current State
Currently implements a modular approach to feature integration, with standardized patterns for entry points, configuration, and localization. Features can be easily integrated into the application with appropriate market-specific configurations and localizations.

## Technical Details
- Entry point management for journeys
- Market-specific feature configuration framework
- Localization and copy management system
- Feature dependency management
- Integration testing automation
- Feature flagging and gradual rollout support

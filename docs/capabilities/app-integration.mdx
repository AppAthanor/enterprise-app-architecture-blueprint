## Overview
The App Integration pillar encompasses all capabilities related to the integration of the mobile application with external systems, platforms, and services. This includes integration with backend services, third-party SDKs, authentication systems, and other components necessary for the application to function properly.

## Current State
Currently provides a robust framework for integrating with a wide range of services and platforms, with standardized interfaces and protocols. Integration patterns are well-established and documented, with reusable components for common integration scenarios.

## Technical Details
- API integration framework
- SDK management system
- Authentication and authorization integration
- Event-based integration architecture
- Integration monitoring and health checks
- Fallback mechanisms for integration failures

## Sub-Capabilities

### [Feature Integration](./app-integration/sub-capabilities/feature-integration.mdx)
Capabilities for integrating features into the application, including entry points, market configuration, and localization.

### [Remote Feature Killswitch](./app-integration/sub-capabilities/remote-feature-killswitch.mdx)
Capability to remotely disable specific features in case of issues.

### [SDKs Integration Per Market](./app-integration/sub-capabilities/sdks-integration-per-market.mdx)
Management of third-party SDK integrations with market-specific configurations.
